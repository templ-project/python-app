> *Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.* â€“ Martin Fowler

> **python** is a template project, designed by [Templ Project](http://templ-project.github.io).
>
> **python** includes instructions for initializing a new [Pyhon](https://python.org) project, and configuring it for
> development, unit testing as well as code linting and analysis.
>
> **python** implements:

## Getting Started

### Prereqiusites / Dependencies

##### For Windows

- Please install [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/download/win) tool.
- Please install a form of make
  - Install [Make for Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
  - Install [make](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/files/) from [ezwinports](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/files/)
  - Install [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), run `choco install make`

##### For Linux/Unix/OSX

- Please install `git` and `make`

```bash
# i.e debian
sudo apt-get install git make -y
# i.e mac OS
brew install make git
```

#### Known Issues / Troubleshooting

- Running Travis CI with Windows fails on `coverage`. Seems Travis CI Windows image has an issue with this.
- Python support starts with version 3.6 and above.

### Installation

1. Clone the project
2. Remove .git folder
3. Re-initialize your git repository
4. Use `make init` to initialize your project
5. If you're targeting to write an application and not a module, use `make init MOD=app`
6. Run `make configure` to configure project or
7. Run `make venv` to create a virtual environment (`make venv` is included in `make configure`)
8. Run `make` to see all your pre-implemented options

```bash
git clone https://github.com/templ-project/python your_project
cd your_project
rm -rf .git
git init
git add remote origin https://url/to/your/project/repository
git add .
git commit -am "init"
git push origin master
make init PROJECT=your_project MODE=mod
# make init PROJECT=your_project MODE=app
make configure
# make venv
# make
```

#### Python version

Most Linux versions, come with python 2.7 as default. The rest of python versions that are installed, can be found having a name similar to `python3.x`, i.e `python3.5`.

To allow using a specific python version, create a file called `Makefile.py-version.include` which should include the following:

```makefile
PY = python3.8
PIP = pip3.8
```

or 

```makefile
PY = /path/to/my/version/of/python
PIP = /path/to/my/version/of/pip
```

When runing `make venv`, the version used by the `Makefile` will be the one defined in this file. 

### Development

#### Requirements

- Please install [Python](https://python.org). Project support **python 3.6 and above**.
- Please instal a Python IDE
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [ITMCDev Python Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=itmcdev.python-extension-pack)
  - [JetBrains PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
  - [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) (see here a [tutorial](https://www.fullstackpython.com/vim.html) for making Vim a Python IDE)
  - Any other IDE you trust.

### Testing

Run unit tests using `make test`.

Testing is currently set to use unittest.

- or you could use `make test TEST_LIB=pytest`
- or you could alter `Makefile.mod.include` to use pytest by default. Just change the commented line as showed:

```makefile
# TEST_LIB=unittest
TEST_LIB=pytest
```

#### Single Tests

Run single unit tests file, by calling `make test-single TEST_PATH=./path/to/file.py`

```bash
make test-single TEST_PATH=./your-project/test/hello.py
```

### Deployment

Adapt `release` directive in your Makefile to fit your needs.

> `make release` will know how to increment version and create tags on its own.
